## ❓ Why we created the Job App Wizard:

The process of a career transition or even a job switch can be tiresome. Always customizing your applications to each posting to ensure you are creating the best resume hitting all the required keywords to pass the companies AI screening system. 

While trying to enter the tech industry after endless job applications and hearing little to no responses, we decided to showcase our python and data science skills by creating this model that can also have utility during our application journey. This will allow us and any users to be more efficient in their job applications to be able to create quality applications without the need to track key words in a job posting manually.

## 🚐 Our Journey:

So far we are in the process of creating the first iteration of the model. Stay tuned for updates...

## 🔮 Future iterations:

- The ability to input a job posting URL or pdf.
- Deploy an app to share with the community.
- Anything else....
